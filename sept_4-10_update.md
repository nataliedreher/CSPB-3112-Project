Since this is the first update there isn't much for me to report as far as what I did last week. The start of this semester hasn't been smooth so I haven't gotten to hit the ground running. I plan on using this Sunday through Tuesday finalizing my planned project for the semester. I'm leaning towards trying to find an idea for a project relating to AI, assuming that I can find a project idea that would be reasonable for a course this size. I also like the suggested idea of learning a new language and creating a project using it, I'd likely choose either Java or Rust.

Beyond the issues directly related to the project I also plan on trying to map out the workload of my three classes so I know when to prioritize certain classes. I think the biggest struggle I'm going to have this semester is balancing my school and workload so I'll have to come up with a solid plan. This should prevent the issues I had this week with another one of my classes.
