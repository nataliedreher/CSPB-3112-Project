        <h3>Week 14 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With the exception of an error I'm running into on one page all of the interface I plan on creating is done. The error I'm receiving is java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'int java.lang.Integer.intValue()' on a null object reference and I think I know the problem as I think I'm iterating one more time than I should be and it's trying to access an index in the integer array that doesn't exist.</li>
            <li>My plan for tomorrow is to fix the error I'm receiving then finishing the game mechanics fragment in my game. After that basic mechanics will be done and I will spend the rest of my time through Sunday working on expanding what I have to make the game bigger. This shouldn't cause me to create more bugs to fix as I tried to make the game fragment files and corresponding XML files as cookie cutter as possible. I should be able to copy and paste the code into more fragments and just change up the dialogue strings. After Sunday I need to shift most of my focus to other classes and so I'm setting that as my estimated completion date.</li>
            <li>Overall I'm back to feeling good about the progress of my project. The final product is going to be a slightly smaller scale than I had planned but I think it's mostly where I was hoping.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 12 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The last couple weeks I mapped out the simple story for my game and got it mostly done. It's not going to be the deepest experience ever but it should be good for a starting place if I want to flesh it out more in the future. Beyond that I worked on the interface for the game however the work has had a lot of stops and starts due to being new at the language.</li>
            <li>My plan for the upcoming couple weeks is to get the framework of the game fully done so that there can be a working prototype. The progress lately has been slow lately and I'm hoping to get past that. I'm super grateful that I have time the next week to get back into a comfortable place as I'm not feeling that good about my progress lately.</li>
            <li>The last few weeks have been a challenge as I've had to deal with some family issues. Plus I injured my thumb at work which has made typing noticeably slower.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 10 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week I finished up on the Android Studio tutorial. I also finally started working on the actual project itself. I only added in the intro screen at this point and my next step is to work with ChatGPT or NovelAI to write out a simple story for my game. Beyond the project I finished working on my resume and started sending it out as of Tuesday.</li>
            <li>My plan for the upcoming week finish my story and then start to implement it. For now I'm just worried about getting the basics implemented with no worries about how it looks.</li>
            <li>The last week the biggest impediment I faced was simply time management. The last update I may not have had a lot of time available but when I had time I felt like I used it well. This last two weeks that was more of a struggle.</li>
            <li>I think the biggest takeaway from my process the last few weeks is to not let myself feel a false sense of security. I had a really good week and a half and I let that give me permission to not quite execute at the level I'm capable of.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 08 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week I got through the rest of my 60 hour work week and then finished up with all of my homework for the next 7 days in my other classes. Once that was fully accomplished I returned to working on my project work. I spent most of Tuesday catching up on finishing the Java fundamentals Coursera class and started the Android development tutorial. I built a test app that is just lorem ipsum and a couple working buttons but it worked in both the Android emulator and on my phone when I tethered it to my PC. Lastly, I started redoing my resume however I haven't quite finished fully revamping it.</li>
            <li>My plan for the upcoming week is first to finish up my resume. After that has been accomplished I plan on finishing the beginner Android development tutorial.</li>
            <li>Honestly this is the first week in a while where I had limited impediments, from Sunday to Wednesday everything went very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Freeing up time to work on everything was a huge boost for me. With everything I was starting to get overwhelmed which was making it harder and harder to focus. Now I think where I need to improve is scheduling out my days, having a freed up schedule is all well and good but I need to build out more of a 3 week plan of action.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 07 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week almost my entire focus has unfortunately been focused on my day job. I did have an exam I had to study for and while that did take up some time I did fantastically so I think it was worth the effort. My biggest accomplishment towards the completion of this project was succeeding in getting the school accommodation I mentioned in last week's update. This mean starting next week and ending the last week of school I will be working shorter than normal schedule with absolutely no mandatory overtime.</li>
            <li>My plan for the upcoming week get through the next couple days of 12 hour shifts. Once my new schedule kicks in I plan of powering through the Java course I've been working on. This should only take a couple hours a day for a couple days, around four hours total. Also, after watching some LinkedIn Learning videos about resume writing I plan on completely redoing my resume in the next 7 days.</li>
            <li>Like last week my biggest impediment was a complete lack of time to work on this project. As I have mentioned this is the last week I'll have this problem.</li>
            <li>Since I couldn't really work on the project this last week there isn't a lot to reflect on. Now that I've freed up my work week quite a bit I plan on organizing a new schedule to get me back on track and into the swing of things for this project.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 06 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week I ended up having to work mandatory overtime at my day job. I also had to finish two large homework assignments and take an exam. Because of how full my schedule ended up being this left very little time to focus on work towards this project. I only managed to watch about 1 hour of Java tutorials plus work on the weekly requirements. I wasn't able to work on updating my personal webpage so that will remain on my priority list.</li>
            <li>My plan for the upcoming week is to survive. I have another exam to do in the next 7 days and a moderate sized homework assignment. Beyond school I will have to work 60 hours at my day job which overall won't leave much time to further this project. I have a meeting with my company's HR to see about getting a school accommodation which will prevent this issue for the rest of the semester.</li>
            <li>Reiterating what I mentioned above my biggest impediment this last week was a near complete lack of time to actively work towards this project. This shouldn't be a forever problem so at this point I'm not too worried.</li>
            <li>Overall, given my circumstances, I think I did about as well as I could this last week. The most important thing I did was applying for the school accommodation. This will free up time for this project plus it will help make sure I don't get overwhelmed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Week 05 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week I mainly worked on learning Java and getting ahead in other classes.</li>
            <li>During this next week I plan on working on my personal website. I like the layout and aesthetics however it's out of date so I need to fix that. I may have to brush up on my React skills. I probably won't have time for as much Coursera work this week.</li>
            <li>No impediments this week though I might have to put the Java learning on the back burner for a week. I have a ton of other work in my two other classes.</li>
            <li>Did pretty well this last week. I'm officially ahead in my other classwork and I'm at least progressing on the Java learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 04 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <strong>What did you do last week?</strong>

            <li>Got slightly ahead in other classes</li>

            <strong>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</strong>

            <li>I need to work more on managing priorities to avoid having to finish some assignments last minute.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 03 - Update</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <strong>What did you do last week?</strong>
            <li>Researched project ideas
            <li>Developed project plan></li>
            <li>Started finding learning resources.</li>
            <strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong>

            <li>Begin Coursera Java course.</li>
            <strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong>

            <li>Time management issues relating to work-school-life balance.</li>
            <strong>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</strong>

            <li>Work on getting at least a little bit ahead in my other classes so I can free up the brain-space to start the Java learning process in earnest.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 02 - Update</h3>
        <p>
            Since this is the first update there isn't much for me to report as far as what I did last week. The start of this semester hasn't been smooth so I haven't gotten to hit the ground running. I plan on using this Sunday through Tuesday finalizing my planned project for the semester. I'm leaning towards trying to find an idea for a project relating to AI, assuming that I can find a project idea that would be reasonable for a course this size. I also like the suggested idea of learning a new language and creating a project using it, I'd likely choose either Java or Rust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the issues directly related to the project I also plan on trying to map out the workload of my three classes so I know when to prioritize certain classes. I think the biggest struggle I'm going to have this semester is balancing my school and workload so I'll have to come up with a solid plan. This should prevent the issues I had this week with another one of my classes.
