    <h2>Text-Based Adventure Game</h2>
    <h3>Vision statement</h3>
    <p>I will be making a simple Text-Based Adventure Game Android application which will ideally be made available in Google Play Store.</p>
    <h3>Motivation </h3>
    <p>The first goal of this project is to learn the basics of Java. Java is an incredibly popular language that many companies use so it makes sense to gain experience with this language. The second goal is to learn the basics of Android app development. Many companies utilize android applications so having this experience would also be beneficial for me.</p>
    <h3>Specific and measurable goals</h3>
    <p>The first 6-8 weeks I will dedicate solely to learning Java. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-java-free-java-courses-for-beginners/" target="_blank">Freecodecamp.com</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data?specialization=java-programming" target="_blank">Coursera</a> have free Java learning courses available which I will be utilizing. After the first 6-8 weeks I will add in courses related to android development which will also build on the Java courses. <a href="https://developer.android.com/get-started/overview" target="_blank">Android.com</a> has free learning resources which should prove helpful.</p>
    <h3>Risks to project completion</h3>
    <p>There is one main risk to this project itself, which is that I’m committing to learning two separate things, Java and Android studio. It might be that I’m taking on too much for this project. The other main risk is related to time management. I am enrolled in two other classes, both of which also have project which means I will have to balance finishing three separate projects at once.</p>

    <h3>Mitigation Strategy</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Be proactive.</strong> I need to make sure to hit all my goals quickly and not fall behind on the language learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Since the goal of this project is learning Java and Android development, I need to make sure aspects of this project that are unrelated to these goals are kept as simple as possible. To that end I plan on using either Novel.ai or ChatGPT to write the story aspects. I also plan on having as basic of a UI as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Utilize multiple learning resources.</strong> Online Java resources are widely available and many seem to be quite thorough. If I’m not getting enough knowledge related to this project out of the above resources, I’ll need to seek out additional resources.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Project Assessments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The largest measure of success for my project will be to have a completed app that is available in the android app store.</li>
        <li>Another important measure of success will be ensuring the app works fairly well and is at least somewhat presentable.</li>
        <li>The last measure of success is for the app to be at least somewhat fun to play. No one wants to play a terrible game.</li>
    </ul>
