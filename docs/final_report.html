    <h2>Text-Based Adventure Game</h2>
    <h3>Final Report</h3>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Overview Of Project Progression</h3>
    <p>At the start of this class I struggled a bit with what kind of project I wanted to pursue. I settled on learning a new language and framework. To that end I decided to make an an Android app using Java as the backend language. I decided on a text based game because I wanted a fun project. I started this journey by auditing the following course from Couresa: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-introduction" target="_blank">java-introduction</a>. Some of my progress came to a halt when my work schedule became on manageable. After solving that problem I finished up the Java course and began work on Android Studio. To get started on Android Studio I began with the resources from <a href="https://developer.android.com/get-started/overview" target="_blank">Android.com</a>. After running through the full tutorial I began work on my game. Initially I was going to just make a standard adventure game but after a while I decided on something different. In the game you play as a bartender at a tavern in a fantasy setting. You start by entering in some demographics. After that the game starts with your mother informing you that you she owes 500 gold and if you don't come up with the money in 5 days you will lose your home. Your job is to try to earn good enough tips via bantering with your patrons make the needed gold. As far as the mechanics of the implementation goes I got almost everything I decided I wanted to included. What I planned on including that made it into the current release:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The ability to enter and save player information through a single play through.</li>
        <li>A branching dialogue structure leading to differing tip amounts.</li>
        <li>Randomized patron selection from a predefined cast.</li>
        <li>A method to track the day and the amount of gold a player has.</li>
        <li>A method to track if the player has made enough gold.</li>  
    </ol>
   
    <p>What didn't quite make the cut:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Full use of demographics. Currently only the name is used in game.</li>
        <li>While the dialogue tree structure was finished I ran out of time to generate the actual dialogue as using ChatGPT ended up being very unwieldy to generate 18-27 lines of dialogue per character for 21 separate characters.</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>The last step of my project was to learn how to publish the app itself. This step isn't fully complete as I've made the decision to hold off on </p>
    <br>
    <h3>What did I actually learn?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned a lot about how Android Studio works.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li style="margin-left:2em">For the most part Android Studio in very intuitively built and there is a robust community of developers so it's very easy to find solutions to quirks with the IDE.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I learned a lot about Android code structure</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li style="margin-left:2em">Android is very tight in how different files/classes share methods and variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I learned that Android development is very satisfying.</li>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: square; margin-left:2em">It's really cool to implement something then immediately be able to test it out.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I learned that it's incredibly easy to get null pointer errors in Java.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Project Assessments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Complete... sort of.</strong> The largest measure of success for my project will be to have a completed app that is available in the android app store.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li style="margin-left:2em">While the game is not published on the play store it is available on my github for download. I want to have the game slightly more finished before publishing on an official platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Complete.</strong> Another important measure of success will be ensuring the app works fairly well and is at least somewhat presentable.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li style="margin-left:2em">What functionality that is implemented works very well and while the app isn't gorgeous by any means but it's not too shabby.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Complete?</strong>The last measure of success is for the app to be at least somewhat fun to play. No one wants to play a terrible game.</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square; padding-bottom: 0;">
            <li style="margin-left:2em">This is very subjective but I think the concept is fun and when it's fully implemented it will be a fun way to play around for 10-20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The biggest takeaway I have from this project is that using building an Android app to learn Java isn't the best was to go about things. While I do think I gained a very noticeable amount of skill in Java I learned so much more about Android app development that this project became mostly about learning Android development. That being said I don't regret the choice to make an Android app however if I could do it again I would've had the goal to learn about app development with learning Java being more of a fringe benefit.</p>
