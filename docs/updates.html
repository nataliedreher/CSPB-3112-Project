        <h3>Week 06 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week I ended up having to work manditory overtime at my day job. I also had to finish two large homework assignments and take an exam. Because of how full my schedule ended up being this left very little time to focus on work towards this project. I only mananged to watch about 1 hour of Java tutorials plus work on the weekly requirements. I wasn't able to work on updating my personal webpage so that will remain on my priority list.</li>
            <li>My plan for the upcoming week is to survive. I have another exam to do in the next 7 days and a moderate sized homework assignment. Beyond school I will have to work 60 hours at my day job which overall won't leave much time to further this project. I have a meeting with my company's HR to see about getting a school accommodation which will prevent this issue for the rest of the semester.</li>
            <li>Reiterating what I mentioned above my biggest impediment this last week was a near complete lack of time to actively work towards this project. This shouldn't be a forever problem so at this point I'm not too worried.</li>
            <li>Overall, given my circumstances, I think I did about as well as I could this last week. The most important thing I did was applying for the school accommodation. This will free up time for this project plus it will help make sure I don't get overwhelmed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Week 05 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This last week I mainly worked on learning Java and getting ahead in other classes.</li>
            <li>During this next week I plan on working on my personal website. I like the layout and aesthetics however it’s out of date so I need to fix that. I may have to brush up on my React skills. I probably won’t have time for as much Coursera work this week.</li>
            <li>No impediments this week though I might have to put the Java learning on the back burner for a week. I have a ton of other work in my two other classes.</li>
            <li>Did pretty well this last week. I’m officially ahead in my other classwork and I’m at least progressing on the Java learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 04 - Update</h3>
        <ul>
            <strong>What did you do last week?</strong>

            <strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong>

            <li>Time management, still…</li>
            <strong>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</strong>

            <li>I need to work more on managing priorities to avoid having to finish some assignments last minute.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 03 - Update</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <strong>What did you do last week?</strong>
            <li>Researched project ideas
            <li>Developed project plan></li>
            <li>Started finding learning resources.</li>
            <strong>What do you plan to do this week?</strong>

            <li>Begin Coursera Java course.</li>
            <strong>Are there any impediments in your way?</strong>

            <li>Time management issues relating to work-school-life balance.</li>
            <strong>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</strong>

            <li>Work on getting at least a little bit ahead in my other classes so I can free up the brain-space to start the Java learning process in earnest.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Week 02 - Update</h3>
        <p>
            Since this is the first update there isn’t much for me to report as far as what I did last week. The start of this semester hasn’t been smooth so I haven’t gotten to hit the ground running. I plan on using this Sunday through Tuesday finalizing my planned project for the semester. I’m leaning towards trying to find an idea for a project relating to AI, assuming that I can find a project idea that would be reasonable for a course this size. I also like the suggested idea of learning a new language and creating a project using it, I’d likely choose either Java or Rust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the issues directly related to the project I also plan on trying to map out the workload of my three classes so I know when to prioritize certain classes. I think the biggest struggle I’m going to have this semester is balancing my school and workload so I’ll have to come up with a solid plan. This should prevent the issues I had this week with another one of my classes.
